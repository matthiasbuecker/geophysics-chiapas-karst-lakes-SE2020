# Transient electromagnetic (TEM) data

## Raw data (01_raw)
This subfolder contains the transient electromagnetic data sets of lakes Metzabok (MET) and Tzibaná (TZI) acquired in March 2018. The following table summarizes the available data.

| Lake | Acquisition date | Number of soundings |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Metzabok | 03/14/2018  | 25 |
| Tzibaná | 03/13/2018 and 03/14/2018 | 71 |
| **Total** | | **96** |

For every line, TEM sounding data are provided as a separate *.tem* file for each sounding. Location and water-depth data for the soundings are listed for each lake in the *.txt* files included in the raw-data directory. 

## Smooth models (02_smooth_models)
This subfolder contains the smooth 20-layer models inverted with ZONDTEM1D.

## Visualization (03_visualization)
