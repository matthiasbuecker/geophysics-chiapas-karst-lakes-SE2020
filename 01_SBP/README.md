# Sub-bottom profiler (SBP) data

This subfolder contains the sub-bottom profiler data sets of lakes Metzabok (MET) and Tzibaná (TZI) acquired in March 2018. The following table summarizes the available data.

| Lake | Acquisition date | Line orientation | Number of lines |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Metzabok | 03/13/2018 | North-South/South-North | 17 |
|   |  | East-West/West-East | 3 |
| Tzibaná | 03/12/2018 and 03/13/2018 |North-South/South-North | 23 |
|   |  | East-West/West-East | 19 |
| **Total** | | | **62** |

For every line, sounding and navigation data are provided as *.seg* and *.csv* files, respectively. For some lines, we also provide the *.odc* files (proprietary). Sound-velocity profiles (SVP) for both lakes were measured with a DigibarS and are provided in the corresponding excel sheets.

## Scripts
This directory contains Matlab scripts (*.m* files) for the visualization of the SBP data. To read the SBP data from the *.seg* files, we use functions provided by Stuart Kozola (2020). The corresponding package has to be downloaded from the MATLAB Central File Exchange before our visualization scripts can be run.
